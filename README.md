## Background

In the era of globalization, the demand for skilled and competent labor is increasing, especially in developed countries like Japan. Indonesian Migrant Workers (TKI) in Japan have experienced significant growth, demonstrating great potential in the international labor market.

## Problem Statement

However, the selection of internship candidates for job opportunities in Japan presents unique challenges related to cultural, language, and academic differences. The lengthy selection process needs to be streamlined and optimized to evaluate the best candidates quickly and accurately based on relevant criteria.

## Methodology

The Entropy-CODAS method will be implemented to effectively determine potential internship participants. Using Entropy weighting, the weighting process is data-driven, reducing bias in determining weights. The CODAS method allows for a more comprehensive assessment when comparing alternatives.

## Results

This study produces an alternative ranking and validation using the Spearman rank correlation between the Entropy-CODAS method and historical data. Among 58 internship candidate alternatives, the first rank was achieved by alternative A17 with a score of 16.0672 as the best internship candidate.

## Conclusion

Based on validation through the Spearman rank correlation, a coefficient value of 0.76 was obtained, indicating a strong relationship, making this method applicable for the selection process of internship candidates in Japan. This research is expected to reduce selection time and increase objectivity in selecting internship candidates for Japan.
